# Lesson Plan

## Summary

The lesson is broken up into two parts: hacking and coding. The first session involves hacking an existing game in Unity to make it do new things. This serves as a concrete example of game development in general, and Unity in particular. The remaining sessions involve adding an additional element that requires new code to be written. By the end, students should have all made the same game.

## Prerequisites

None. Any experience writing code is a plus.
