# Type-along Coding

To thoroughly demonstrate each step of the writing of code, we encourage alternating between writing code *live* in front of students and taking time to answer questions individually while they transcribe it. Broken down into steps:

1. Beforehand, break the coding into chunks or steps that can fit on a single screen
2. Connect your laptop to a projector and mirror the displays
3. Write code *live* and ask your students to type-along with you
4. When finished typing, expect a few advanced students to be caught up, but most students to still be typing
5. Pose a challenge to the students who are done, suggesting the next step
6. Take a moment to go around the room and make sure everyone else is caught up
7. Have short one-on-one conversations with each student about the state of their code, what they are confused about, and answer questions they may not be willing to ask out loud (In a large classroom, this is a good task for teaching assistants or co-teachers to help with)
8. When finished, return to your computer, have a short discussion about the chunk everyone just wrote, and begin the next step.

This approach has several benefits:

1. The current step remains on the screen for students to **transcribe at their own pace**
2. Asking the students to type the code themselves (as opposed to downloading or copy-pasting) acquaints them with the **tactile experience of writing code** with their fingers, and the particularities of text editing tools
3. **You will make mistakes when writing code — that’s great!** This demonstrates that encountering errors regularly, dealing with them, and moving on are a fundamental part of the experience of programming
4. You can structure your code steps to **keep advanced students challenged** while helping those who are not caught up
5. You ensure that everyone is on the same page before moving on, and its **harder for someone to fall way behind**

Make sure your font size is large enough to be read comfortably by everyone in the room. This might mean writing code at a comically large size, and might affect your ability to write code comfortably. Experiment with this during classroom preparation if possible.
