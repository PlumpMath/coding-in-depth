## Errors

It is important to stress the point about errors in the [type-along coding](type-along.md) chapter. There is a myth among programmers, particularly among new programmers, that errors are “wrong” and a sign that they’re “not good” at programming. Some have the feeling that when they’re “good” programmers, they simply will not see error messages again.

The aesthetics of error messages encourage this: stop signs, exclamation points, bombs with lit fuses, ominous red and black text. This, of course, couldn’t be farther from the truth, and this is an excellent opportunity to push back against that notion.

Talking about error messages is tricky to do. It is easy to sound condescending, which defeats the purpose. By live coding and demonstrating that errors are not a big deal and that “even the instructor” consistently makes them and deals with them, though, you can communicate this point more powerfully.

### A Friend with a Bagel

We've explain programming errors as "situations where the computer does not have enough information to proceed and is asking for help" or "situations where what you wanted is not clear to the computer." An example we like to give is asking a friend to grab you a bagel from the deli when they head out. If it turns out that the deli has three kinds of bagels, your friend wouldn’t know which one you wanted, so they might phone you and ask. That phone call is an error message. This is both closer to technical reality and much less off-putting to new programmers.
