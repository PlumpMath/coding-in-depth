# Setup
Normalizing the classroom is *crucial* to a successful coding workshop. This means that every computer is running the same:

1. Operating System and Version
2. Game Engine and Version
3. Text Editor and Version
4. Programming Language

Additionally, things often thought of as preferences should be identical as well. Syntax highlighting colors, window layout, any difference between student machines and the instructorâ€™s machine is a potential source of confusion. With time allocated towards preparing the room, this can be eliminated.

In situations where the running software cannot be normalized beforehand, anticipate these differences as sources of confusion, and prepare extra time for it.

## Unity Version
The game is tested on Unity 5.5.1f1, but should work on any Unity in the 5.x range.

## Code Editor
We recommend using Unity's built-in [MonoDevelop](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MonoDevelop.html) as the editor for the class. This has the benefit of coming installed with Unity, so no additional software needs to be chased down, and offering robust code completion that can aid in instruction.

The inline help and feedback on method arguments can go a long way in guiding new programmers towards correct code.
