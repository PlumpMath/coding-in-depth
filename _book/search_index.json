Understanding these ideas is crucial to using Unity effectively, and working contrary to them will cause a lot of undue headache.\nGames In General\nThe core idea behind Unity is that most games are full of \"things\" that interact with each other and react to player actions in different ways over time. For example, some of the \"things\" in Asteroids are the player's ship, the asteroids, and the player's bullets. The way they interact with eachother is different for each \"thing\" and might depend on events are happening in the game. For example, when a bullet touches an asteroid, the asteroid disappears, and is replaced with three smaller asteroids. When the player presses the right arrow key, the ship turns right. Most games can be described by different \"things\" and how they interact.\n\nExercise Have the class identify \"things\" and interactions in other games, and suggest your own.\nUnity In Particular\nUnity calls these \"things\" GameObjects. Everything in your game is a GameObject. Players, enemies, pickups, parts of levels. Even things that are not immediately visible are GameObjects, like the area that marks the finish line in a racing game or the starting point in a platformer.\nGameObjects on their own do not do anything, and they are all equal. There is not, for example, a camera GameObject and a spaceship GameObject, just GameObjects. They are blank, empty containers waiting to be filled with the logic and behavior that comes from Components. A Component is a chunk of code designed to do one specific thing when attached to a GameObject. Some common Components are built in to Unity. These include the Camera Component that draws the scene on the screen, the Rigidbody Component that makes GameObjects move with realistic physics, or the AudioSource Component that plays sound files. You will not have to recreate these for every game. But more game-specific logic, like the way the player moves, or how pickups work, will need to be specified by the game developer by writing code.\nSo, GameObjects contain Components, and Components must be attached to GameObjects. Unity’s core idea is: everything in your game is a GameObject, and you tell GameObjects how to act and how to look by attaching Components to them.\n\nAs an example, the player's ship in Asteroids could be a GameObject with:\n\nA component specifying what image to use to draw the ship\nA component specifying its position and rotation\nA component that creates a bullet GameObject when the player presses a button\nA component that rotates the ship when the player presses left or right\nA component that moves the ship forward the player presses forward or backwards\nA component that removes the ship when it touches an Asteroid\n\nThat's a lot of components! This is how Unity wants you to build your games, though. The idea is that if you write small, generic components that aren't tied to one particular GameObject, you can re-use them on other GameObjects.\nExercise Ask the class to try and break down popular \"things\" in video games into Unity-style Components. Ask the students what games they play and what \"things\" they contain that can be broken down, and suggest your own. Guide them towards thinking of common, reusable Components between \"things\".\nIf Mario was made in Unity, there would be no “mario” object, just a normal GameObject named Mario with a Component that says what he looks like, a Component that says how he should move, a Component that says how he can get hurt, and so on.\nOnce you're thinking in terms of GameObjects and Components, you're ready to take on Unity!\nThe way you organize your game, the number of Components and what goes in them is up to the developers. Every team finds a style that works for it, and it is not an exact science. For example, in the earlier Asteroids player ship example, the movement and rotation Component could be combined into one. This would not be \"wrong\" and breaking them apart is not necessarily \"better\". Stress this with your class!\nTake Aways\n\nUnity organizes games into GameObjects and Components\nGameObjects organize all the \"things\" in your game and contain Components\nComponents implement behavior and logic, and only exist attached to GameObjects\nComponents are either built in to Unity or are programmed by you\nThe only way to write code in Unity is to make new components and attach them to GameObjects\n\n"},"ui.html":{"url":"ui.html","title":"Unity's UI","keywords":"","body":"Session 1\nUnity’s UI\nThe Game view shows is what the player will see, and the Project window is a list of all the files in the project, including images, sounds, and code.\nThe remaining tabs are a direct reflection of Unity's semantics. Stress that the Scene view and Hierarchy window show all the GameObjects in the game, but in different ways:\n\nThe Scene Tab is a visual, 3D representation, useful for a preview of how things will look or to move things around\nThe Hierarchy is a searchable list, useful if you can’t visually find a GameObject or if you need to see how GameObjects are nested.\n\nDemonstration Demonstrate that GameObjects can be selected by clicking on them in the Scene or Hierarchy Tabs. Stress that clicking on an object in the Scene Tab selects in Hierarchy Tab and vice versa — they are the same object.\nThe Inspector window displays information on the currently selected objects. When GameObjects are selected, it displays the GameObjects' information (name, layer, etc) as well as every Component attached to them.\nThis is an excellent place to stress the GameObject/Component relationship. The visual layout of the inspector places GameObject information at the top, and the rest is a list of Components.\n\n\n\n"},"play-and-hack.html":{"url":"play-and-hack.html","title":"Play and Hack","keywords":"","body":"Session 1\nPlay and Hack\nPlay\nHave students play the game for some time. Afterwards, ask them what they thought. Possible questions include:\n\nWas it fun?\nIf so, how?\nIf not, why?\nWhat would they change?\n\nThis does not need to be an in-depth game-literacy focused discussion, but deep enough to give the students concrete goals when they hack the game.\nHack the game\nHave youd students tweak values, add and remove components so that the game plays differently without writing code. The challenge is to make a game that is as different as possible before any code is introduced. This stresses the importance and power of the GameObject/Compoent design of Unity. Ideally, this excersise will lead students to get excited by modifying the game, but frustrated at the limitations of value tweaking. This frustration speaks to the importance of writing code, whithout which you are beholden to modifying the work of others.\nThe components that make up the game are designed for this. Their names are descriptive and every field is commented with the role it plays. Familiarize yourself with the components before class so you can effectively guide the students in hacking the game.\nA focused prompt or challenge is a good way to guide students in an otherwise open ended excersise. In addition to their ideas of what they would change about the game from earlier, possible prompts include:\n\nHow can we make the game really hard?\nHow can we make the game really easy?\nHow can we make the game \"better\" ?\n\nWork through the first prompt together. State the goal clearly, and tweak the values of the game to achieve it. Make sure to demonstrate\n\nChanging values on a component\nAdding a component\nRemoving a component\n\nat least once each. Follow the guidance of type-along coding (even though no code is being written yet).\nOnce everyone has that mod working, present them with another prompt, and let them tackle that on their own.

This is non-critical information, but might help answer questions that come up.\nIn many respects, video game development is a lot like other kinds of programming. It is unique in one important way, however: the goal is an aesthetic, human experience. This means “success” is highly subjective, and as a result iteration and playtesting are indispensable. The effect that has on the kind of programming you end up doing in games is that the flexibility of your code is important to ensure that you remain able to adapt to new creative ideas. This is radically different from, say, programming a server, where there will be a specification and a narrow definition of what is correct. Here, iteration is less important, and the kind of code you write changes accordingly.\n_start:\n        # write(1, message, 13)\n        mov     $1, %rax\n        mov     $1, %rdi\n        mov     $message, %rsi\n        mov     $13, %rdx\n        syscall\n        mov     $60, %rax\n        xor     %rdi, %rdi\n        syscall\nmessage:\n        .ascii  \"Hello, world\\n\"\n\nFrom http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x86assembly/\n\nThe original programming paradigm of the 1950s was imperative, where programs were nothing more than a sequence of machine level commands. There were no named variables, limited support for named blocks of code, mostly memory addresses that could be read and written to, no loops or conditionals, just “branch statements” to jump to different instructions, and no named functions, just blocks of code. Assembly languages for different computers fall into this category, and this kind of programming is still done on some low level systems.\n#include \n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\n}\n\nFrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#.22Hello.2C_world.22_example\n\nShortly following that was the structured programming of the late 1950s and 1960s. Most of the progress was being made in America, and these languages allowed programmers to assign English names to their variables and functions which made it easier for them to read and manage.\n"},"type-along.html":{"url":"type-along.html","title":"Type-along Coding","keywords":"","body":"Type-along Coding\nTo thoroughly demonstrate each step of the writing of code, we encourage alternating between writing code live in front of students and taking time to answer questions individually while they transcribe it. Broken down into steps:\n\nBeforehand, break the coding into chunks or steps that can fit on a single screen\nConnect your laptop to a projector and mirror the displays\nWrite code live and ask your students to type-along with you\nWhen finished typing, expect a few advanced students to be caught up, but most students to still be typing\nPose a challenge to the students who are done, suggesting the next step\nTake a moment to go around the room and make sure everyone else is caught up\nHave short one-on-one conversations with each student about the state of their code, what they are confused about, and answer questions they may not be willing to ask out loud (In a large classroom, this is a good task for teaching assistants or co-teachers to help with)\nWhen finished, return to your computer, have a short discussion about the chunk everyone just wrote, and begin the next step.\n\nThis approach has several benefits:\n\nThe current step remains on the screen for students to transcribe at their own pace\nAsking the students to type the code themselves (as opposed to downloading or copy-pasting) acquaints them with the tactile experience of writing code with their fingers, and the particularities of text editing tools\nYou will make mistakes when writing code — that’s great! This demonstrates that encountering errors regularly, dealing with them, and moving on are a fundamental part of the experience of programming\nYou can structure your code steps to keep advanced students challenged while helping those who are not caught up\nYou ensure that everyone is on the same page before moving on, and its harder for someone to fall way behind\n\nMake sure your font size is large enough to be read comfortably by everyone in the room. This might mean writing code at a comically large size, and might affect your ability to write code comfortably. Experiment with this during classroom preparation if possible.\n"},"errors.html":{"url":"errors.html","title":"Errors","keywords":"","body":"Errors\nIt is important to stress the point about errors in the type-along coding chapter. There is a myth among programmers, particularly among new programmers, that errors are “wrong” and a sign that they’re “not good” at programming. Some have the feeling that when they’re “good” programmers, they simply will not see error messages again.\n\nThe aesthetics of error messages encourage this: stop signs, exclamation points, bombs with lit fuses, ominous red and black text. This, of course, couldn’t be farther from the truth, and this is an excellent opportunity to push back against that notion.\nTalking about error messages is tricky to do. It is easy to sound condescending, which defeats the purpose. By live coding and demonstrating that errors are not a big deal and that “even the instructor” consistently makes them and deals with them, though, you can communicate this point more powerfully.\nA Friend with a Bagel\nWe've explain programming errors as \"situations where the computer does not have enough information to proceed and is asking for help\" or \"situations where what you wanted is not clear to the computer.\" An example we like to give is asking a friend to grab you a bagel from the deli when they head out. If it turns out that the deli has three kinds of bagels, your friend wouldn’t know which one you wanted, so they might phone you and ask. That phone call is an error message. This is both closer to technical reality and much less off-putting to new programmers.\n"},"csharp-vs-unity.html":{"url":"csharp-vs-unity.html","title":"C# vs Unity","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nC# vs Unity\nUnity is the game engine we are working in, but C# is the programming language we are writing code in. Their relationship is important to explain.\nC# the language\nC# is a language designed by Microsoft in 1999. It is object oriented, meaning it wants you to organize your code into classes. Classes are collections of data called fields and code called methods. C# doesn't tell you exactly how you organize your code, but classes, fields, and methods are the tools it gives you.\nAnother important aspect of C# is that it is statically typed, meaning that every value has to be annotated with the type of data it represents. A type can be something built in to C#, like numbers (e.g. int, float) or a class written in C#. In practice, these classes either come from Microsoft (like DateTime), Unity (like AudioClip), a library you imported, or you.\nClasses vs Instances\nThe difference between classes and instances is a consistent source of confusion, and unfortunately unavoidable in Unity. \nC# In Unity\nUnity uses C#'s object oriented features to implement very different ideas, namely the entity-component-system. These two approaches can seem in tension at times, and can result in a bit of repetitive code.\n"}}}
