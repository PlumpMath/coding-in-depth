Fashion: Coding In Depth\nThis module of Playable Fashion is deep dive into to the basics of Unity game development.\nThe Game\nThis module is designed around an Asteroids clone. The player controls a ship with the keyboard keys, rotating with left and right, moving forward and backward with up and down, firing bullets with the space bar, and must destroy a field of asteroids in order to win. Each asteroid spawns three smaller asteroids when destroyed, and the smaller asteroids do not spawn anything. If the user touches an asteroid, they lose.\n\nThe class will hack on this game, modifying its components to make new experiences. Additionally, the class will write the code needed to add an enemy to the game with basic AI that will follow the player and fire bullets at them.\n\nIt is designed to be hit all of the major corners of Unity while remaining hackable and teachable. The components are well commented and designed to be interchanged.\nImportantly, the scripts that the class will write together to implement the enemy are left out of the package, as their availability would defeat the purpose of writing them.\nFolder Structure\nScripts\nThe components of the game are all well commented. Their inner workings and variables are all explained in the source code. There are many components included that are not used in the game, but can be added during the hacking session.\nPrefabs\nThe game uses prefabs for bullets, asteroid spawning, and the game over screens.\nArt\nWe include a bunch of art from kenney.nl that students can use while customizing the game.\n"},"type-along.html":{"url":"type-along.html","title":"Type-along Coding","keywords":"","body":"Type-along Coding\nTo thoroughly demonstrate each step of the writing of code, we encourage alternating between writing code live in front of students and taking time to answer questions individually while they transcribe it. Broken down into steps:\n\nBeforehand, break the coding into chunks or steps that can fit on a single screen\nConnect your laptop to a projector and mirror the displays\nWrite code live and ask your students to type-along with you\nWhen finished typing, expect a few advanced students to be caught up, but most students to still be typing\nPose a challenge to the students who are done, suggesting the next step\nTake a moment to go around the room and make sure everyone else is caught up\nHave short one-on-one conversations with each student about the state of their code, what they are confused about, and answer questions they may not be willing to ask out loud (In a large classroom, this is a good task for teaching assistants or co-teachers to help with)\nWhen finished, return to your computer, have a short discussion about the chunk everyone just wrote, and begin the next step.\n\nThis approach has several benefits:\n\nThe current step remains on the screen for students to transcribe at their own pace\nAsking the students to type the code themselves (as opposed to downloading or copy-pasting) acquaints them with the tactile experience of writing code with their fingers, and the particularities of text editing tools\nYou will make mistakes when writing code — that’s great! This demonstrates that encountering errors regularly, dealing with them, and moving on are a fundamental part of the experience of programming\nYou can structure your code steps to keep advanced students challenged while helping those who are not caught up\nYou ensure that everyone is on the same page before moving on, and its harder for someone to fall way behind\n\nMake sure your font size is large enough to be read comfortably by everyone in the room. This might mean writing code at a comically large size, and might affect your ability to write code comfortably. Experiment with this during classroom preparation if possible.\n"},"errors.html":{"url":"errors.html","title":"Errors","keywords":"","body":"Errors\nIt is important to stress the point about errors in the type-along coding chapter. There is a myth among programmers, particularly among new programmers, that errors are “wrong” and a sign that they’re “not good” at programming. Some have the feeling that when they’re “good” programmers, they simply will not see error messages again.\n\nThe aesthetics of error messages encourage this: stop signs, exclamation points, bombs with lit fuses, ominous red and black text. This, of course, couldn’t be farther from the truth, and this is an excellent opportunity to push back against that notion.\nTalking about error messages is tricky to do. It is easy to sound condescending, which defeats the purpose. By live coding and demonstrating that errors are not a big deal and that “even the instructor” consistently makes them and deals with them, though, you can communicate this point more powerfully.\nA Friend with a Bagel\nWe've explain programming errors as \"situations where the computer does not have enough information to proceed and is asking for help\" or \"situations where what you wanted is not clear to the computer.\" An example we like to give is asking a friend to grab you a bagel from the deli when they head out.

This is non-critical information, but might help answer questions that come up.\nIn many respects, video game development is a lot like other kinds of programming. It is unique in one important way, however: the goal is an aesthetic, human experience. This means “success” is highly subjective, and as a result iteration and playtesting are indispensable. The effect that has on the kind of programming you end up doing in games is that the flexibility of your code is important to ensure that you remain able to adapt to new creative ideas. This is radically different from, say, programming a server, where there will be a specification and a narrow definition of what is correct. Here, iteration is less important, and the kind of code you write changes accordingly.\n_start:\n        # write(1, message, 13)\n        mov     $1, %rax\n        mov     $1, %rdi\n        mov     $message, %rsi\n        mov     $13, %rdx\n        syscall\n        mov     $60, %rax\n        xor     %rdi, %rdi\n        syscall\nmessage:\n        .ascii  \"Hello, world\\n\"\n\nFrom http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x86assembly/\n\nThe original programming paradigm of the 1950s was imperative, where programs were nothing more than a sequence of machine level commands. There were no named variables, limited support for named blocks of code, mostly memory addresses that could be read and written to, no loops or conditionals, just “branch statements” to jump to different instructions, and no named functions, just blocks of code. Assembly languages for different computers fall into this category, and this kind of programming is still done on some low level systems.\n#include \n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\n}\n\nFrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#.22Hello.2C_world.22_example\n\nShortly following that was the structured programming of the late 1950s and 1960s.

Understanding these ideas is crucial to using Unity effectively, and working contrary to them will cause a lot of undue headache.\nGames In General\nThe core idea behind Unity is that most games are full of \"things\" that interact with each other and react to player actions in different ways over time. For example, some of the \"things\" in Asteroids are the player's ship, the asteroids, and the player's bullets. The way they interact with eachother is different for each \"thing\" and might depend on events are happening in the game. For example, when a bullet touches an asteroid, the asteroid disappears, and is replaced with three smaller asteroids. When the player presses the right arrow key, the ship turns right. Most games can be described by different \"things\" and how they interact.\n\nExercise \nHave the class identify \"things\" and interactions in other games, and suggest your own.\nUnity In Particular\nUnity calls these \"things\" GameObjects. Everything in your game is a GameObject. Players, enemies, pickups, parts of levels. Even things that are not immediately visible are GameObjects, like the area that marks the finish line in a racing game or the starting point in a platformer.\nGameObjects on their own do not do anything, and they are all equal. There is not, for example, a camera GameObject and a spaceship GameObject, just GameObjects. They are blank, empty containers waiting to be filled with the logic and behavior that comes from Components. A Component is a chunk of code designed to do one specific thing when attached to a GameObject. Some common Components are built in to Unity. These include the Camera Component that draws the scene on the screen, the Rigidbody Component that makes GameObjects move with realistic physics, or the AudioSource Component that plays sound files. You will not have to recreate these for every game. But more game-specific logic, like the way the player moves, or how pickups work, will need to be specified by the game developer by writing code.\nSo, GameObjects contain Components, and Components must be attached to GameObjects. Unity’s core idea is: everything in your game is a GameObject, and you tell GameObjects how to act and how to look by attaching Components to them.\n\nAs an example, the player's ship in Asteroids could be a GameObject with:\n\nA component specifying what image to use to draw the ship\nA component specifying its position and rotation\nA component that creates a bullet GameObject when the player presses a button\nA component that rotates the ship when the player presses left or right\nA component that moves the ship forward the player presses forward or backwards\nA component that removes the ship when it touches an Asteroid\n\nThat's a lot of components! This is how Unity wants you to build your games, though. The idea is that if you write small, generic components that aren't tied to one particular GameObject, you can re-use them on other GameObjects.\nOnce you're thinking in terms of GameObjects and Components, you're ready to take on Unity!\nThe way you organize your game, the number of Components and what goes in them is up to the developers. Every team finds a style that works for it, and it is not an exact science. For example, in the earlier Asteroids player ship example, the movement and rotation Component could be combined into one. This would not be \"wrong\" and breaking them apart is not necessarily \"better\". Stress with your class that there is always more than one way to solve a problem, and part of the challenge of computer programming is finding an approach that works for everyone involved.\nExercise \nAsk the class to try and break down popular \"things\" in video games into Unity-style Components. Ask the students what games they play and what \"things\" they contain that can be broken down, and suggest your own. Guide them towards thinking of common, reusable Components between \"things\".\nIf Mario was made in Unity, there would be no “mario” object, just a normal GameObject named Mario with a Component that says what he looks like, a Component that says how he should move, a Component that says how he can get hurt, and so on.\nTake Aways\n\nUnity organizes games into GameObjects and Components\nGameObjects organize all the \"things\" in your game and contain Components\nComponents implement behavior and logic, and only exist attached to GameObjects\nComponents are either built into Unity or are programmed by you\nThe only way to write code in Unity is to make new components and attach them to GameObjects\n\n"},"ui.html":{"url":"ui.html","title":"Unity's UI","keywords":"","body":"Session 1\nUnity’s UI\nThe Game view shows is what the player will see, and the Project window is a list of all the files in the project, including images, sounds, and code.\nThe remaining tabs are a direct reflection of Unity's semantics.

Stress that clicking on an object in the Scene Tab selects in Hierarchy Tab and vice versa — they are the same object.\nThe Inspector window displays information on the currently selected objects.

Afterwards, ask them what they thought. Possible questions include:\n\nWas it fun?\nIf so, how?\nIf not, why?\nWhat would they change?\n\nThis does not need to be an in-depth game-literacy focused discussion, but deep enough to give the students concrete goals when they hack the game.\nHack the game\nHave your students tweak values, add and remove components so that the game plays differently without writing code. The challenge is to make a game that is as different as possible before any code is introduced. This stresses the importance and power of the GameObject/Component design of Unity. Ideally, this exercise will lead students to get excited by modifying the game, but frustrated at the limitations of value tweaking. This frustration speaks to the importance of writing code, without which you are beholden to modifying the work of others.\nThe components that make up the game are designed for this. Their names are descriptive and every field is commented with the role it plays. Familiarize yourself with the components before class so you can effectively guide the students in hacking the game.\nA focused prompt or challenge is a good way to guide students in an otherwise open ended exercise. In addition to their ideas of what they would change about the game from earlier, possible prompts include:\n\nHow can we make the game really hard?\nHow can we make the game really easy?\nHow can we make the game \"better\" ?\n\nWork through the first prompt together. State the goal clearly, and tweak the values of the game to achieve it. Make sure to demonstrate\n\nChanging values on a component\nAdding a component\nRemoving a component\n\nat least once each. Follow the guidance of type-along coding (even though no code is being written yet).\nOnce everyone has that mod working, present them with another prompt, and let them tackle that on their own.

This one requires a keybaord and a mouse to control.\nReplace the Asteroids' Forward Mover Components with Follow Mouse Components to make a two player game where one player controls the ship with the keyboard and a second player controls the asteroids with the mouse!

Their relationship is important to explain.\nC# the language\nC# is a language designed by Microsoft in 1999. It is object oriented, meaning it wants you to organize your code into classes. Classes are collections of data called fields and code called methods. C# doesn't tell you exactly how you organize your code, but classes, fields, and methods are the tools it gives you.\nAnother important aspect of C# is that it is what's called a statically typed language, meaning that every value in your code has to be labeled with the type of data it represents. A type can be something built in to C#, like numbers (e.g. int, float) or a class written in C#. In practice, these classes either come from Microsoft (like DateTime), Unity (like AudioClip), a library you imported, or you.\nClasses vs Instances\nThe difference between classes and instances is a consistent source of confusion, and unfortunately unavoidable in Unity. The explanation we've used is that a class is like a design drawing of a car. You can't ride it or use it right away, but it tells you everything you need to know to build an actual car. It tells you what a car can do, what it can't do, its parameters, and so on.\n\nAn instance is like an actual car. You can make as many cars from the same designs as you want, and they'll all be similar in what they can do and how they behave.\n\nBut, they're all unique things now. If you paint one car, it does not affect the rest. On the flipside, if you change the design of the car (the class, in this analogy) to say that all these cars should have three wheels, then when you start making new cars again they will all be affected.\nSo, a class is a blueprint from which instances (or \"objects\") can be made. You can then access the instance fields and methods on that instance. In the following examples we will use the Vector3 and Input classes from Unity.\nVector3 v = new Vector3(3, 4, 5); // v is now an instance of the class Vector3\nv.x;                              // you can access the x instance field\nv.Set(300, 400, 500);             // you can access the Set instance method\n\nBut classes are more than just blueprints in C#. They can contain their own fields and methods that can be accessed from anywhere in the program!\nVector3 w = new Vector3(7, 3, 1);\nVector3 v = new Vector3(3, 4, 5);\nVector3.Distance(w, v); // Vector3.Distance is a method that lives in the Vector3 class itself\nInput.GetKey(\"space\");  // Input.GetKey is a method that lives in the Input class\n\nThis appears to invalidate the \"everything is a GameObject or Component\" rule, but that rule is only true of Unity. C# has its own rules, and to use Unity effectively you need work towards understanding both systems.\nC# In Unity\nUnity uses C#'s object oriented features to implement very different ideas, namely the entity-component-system. These two approaches can seem in tension at times, and can result in a bit of repetitive code.\nWhen you write your own components, you do that by writing a C# class. When you expose parameters to the Unity inspector, you do that by writing public C# fields. When you react to Unity events, you do that by writing C# methods.\n"},"enemy-setup.html":{"url":"enemy-setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nEnemy Setup\nCreate an empty game object and name it \"Enemy\".

C# types live inside of namespaces to avoid overlapping names. Almost everything in Unity is in the UnityEngine namespace, which means that the full names of Unity types are actually UnityEngine.Vector3 and UnityEngine.Collider. This is repetitive, so the using directive says \"in this file, use names from UnityEngine without repeating UnityEngine. every time\". Unity also adds using directives for System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic, which are namespaces built in to C# that Unity thinks are useful.\npublic class AlwaysLookAt : MonoBehaviour\npublic class tells C# that we're about to start writing a class and that it is going to be public, meaning other code can see and use it. Recall that Unity components are implemented as C# classes, and we're going to have to create a class everytime we want to make a new component. You will always want your components to be public, otherwise Unity cannot see or use it. There are other keywords you can put here, called the accessibility levels, and they are useful for C# classes in general to organize your code, but for a Unity component this will always be public.\nFollowing that, finally something familiar: AlwaysLookAt is the name of our component!\nThe : in this context means that our class will inherit from another class, in this case from Unity's MonoBehaviour. C# inheritance is a big topic, and does not come up very often in Unity, so its up to you how deep to get into that. But recall that Components are either built in to Unity or scripts written by developers. inheriting from MonoBehaviour tells Unity that this isn't a \"normal\" C# class, but instead a class intended to be used as a user-defined component.\n//\nC# comments are either // to the end of the line anything between /* and */. The computer ignores this text and its a good place for notes.\nvoid Start (), void Update (),\nUnity calls the events that GameObjects can react to Messages (scroll down half way on the MonoBehaviour page). They are implemented as C# methods on component classes.\nBasically, by writing methods with the right name, Unity will trigger that code when appropriate. It provides components with Start (triggered once when the game starts) and Update (triggered once per frame) methods by default, to be useful. We only need Update, so you can remove Start if you wish or leave it in, it makes no difference.\n"},"fields.html":{"url":"fields.html","title":"Fields","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nFields\nFields are bits of data that components carry around.

Recall that C# is statically typed, meaning we need to announce the kind of data we're manipulating at all times. So this field can store a GameObject.\ntarget\nThis is the name of the field. We see it in the inspector, and this is the name we will use for it in our code. Note that the name as it appears in the inspector (capitalized) is a convenience, and shouldn't be used in code.\nAssigning Values\nAs you can see in the inspector, the default value is None, meaning that target's value is null. We want target to refer to the Player GameObject in the scene so that the next bit of our code can use it. You can give it a value in one of two ways: clicking the little circle on the right brings up a browsable list of all available GameObjects in the project and scene.\n\nOr, the Player object can be dragged in from the Hierarchy.\n\n"},"turning-logic.html":{"url":"turning-logic.html","title":"Turning Logic","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nTurning Logic\nNow that the target field has a value, making the enemy turn to face it is a single line of code, but that line is quite dense.

To understand that, we need to talk about the Transform component and some linear algebra\nThe Transform Component\n\nEvery GameObject in Unity gets a Transform component. It stores the position, rotation, and scale of the GameObject, and enables the nesting of GameObjects (it keeps track of children and parents). It's so important to Unity that you can't even remove it!\nSince the Transform component controls rotation, if we want our AlwaysLookAt component to rotate the GameObject it has to talk to the Transform component. There are a few ways to do this, including the Rotate method, or setting the rotation or eulerAngles properties.\nFor the purposes of this script, however, the easiest thing to do is to set the up property. The up property corresponds to the green axis as seen in the scene view.\n\nIt is a vector, so it is an indication of direction. Assigning it a new value will rotate the object so that the green arrow is facing this new direction. Since our green arrow lines up with the front of the enemy, this causes the enemy to turn and \"face\" in that new direction!\nSyntax\nThe . operator is the member access operator. You can read transform.up as \"get the thing called up from inside the transform object\". Here, transform is shorthand for this.transform, which in turn is shorthand for this.gameObject.transform. this is a special keyword in C# that refers to the current object that your code is running on, in this case the AlwaysLookAt component. The gameObject field refers to the GameObject the component is attached to, and the transform field refers to the Transform component attached to that GameObject. So, transform.up can be read as \"get the up property of the Transform component attached to the same GameObject as me\" from the perspective of the AlwaysLookAt component.\nAssigning a new value is done with the = operator, which assigns the result of the expression on the right of the = symbol to whatever is on the left of the = symbol. transform.up = target.transform.position - transform.position; can be read as \"Assign to the up property of the Transform component attached to the same GameObject as me the result of target.transform.position - transform.position\".\nWe are subtracting two values, target.transform.position and transform.position. Both are accessing the position property of Transform components, but they're accessing them on different GameObjects. Recall that target is a field that we set up that was of type GameObject and we associated it with the Player's GameObject. When we say target.transform.position, we're accessing the position property of the Transform component attached to the GameObject associated with target, in this case the Player. When we say transform.position, we are using the same shorthands mentioned above to access the position property on the Transform component of the GameObject this component is attached to. So we are subtracting the position of the GameObject AlwaysLookAt is attached to (the enemy) from the position of the target (the player).\nBut what does subtracting positions give us?\nLinear Algebra\nIn addition to logic, certain kinds of math are unavoidable in game development. Chief among them is linear algebra, the mathematics of vectors, matrices, and space. Using the fact that points in space can be interpreted as vectors from the origin to those points, we can see below on the right that subtracting two points gives us a vector pointing from one to the other.\n\n\nFrom http://www.askiitians.com/iit-jee-physics/general-physics/addition-and-subtraction-of-vectors.aspx\n\nImagine that the enemy GameObject is at b in the above example, and the Player is at a. Subtracting their positions gives us the vector to look at in order for b to face a, for the enemy to face the player. If we set the green axis (transform.up) to this vector, the enemy will turn to align itself and appear to look at the player.\nExperiments\nA good way to drive home abstract concepts like these is with miniature experiments. Try the following as a class, and discuss the differences you observe:\n\nReplace the line of code in Update with\ntransform.up = transform.position - target.transform.position;\ntransform.right = target.transform.position - transform.position;\ntransform.up = -1 * (target.transform.position - transform.position);\ntransform.up = Vector3.right\n\n\nIn the inspector, associate different objects with target\n\n"},"session-3.html":{"url":"session-3.html","title":"Session 3","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nStudents make the Enemy respond to collision with the player's bullets by disappearing.\n\nGoals\n\nBegin to understand Unity's physics engine\nMake multiple components work together\n\nNew Code\nBy the end of the session, you will have written the following script:\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class DestroySelfOnCollision : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public string otherTag;\n\n    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D otherCollider)\n    {\n        if (otherCollider.gameObject.tag == otherTag)\n        {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n"},"destroy-setup.html":{"url":"destroy-setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nSetup\nLay out the problem in plain english: \"When the player's bullet touches the enemy, the enemy should disappear\" and begin to break that down into questions:\n\n\"When the player's bullet touches the enemy\"\nHow do we know when two GameObjects touch?\nHow do we tell GameObjects apart?\n\n\n\"the enemy should disappear\"\nHow do we remove GameObjects?\n\n\n\nThese three questions will guide the session.\n"},"collision.html":{"url":"collision.html","title":"Collision Detection","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nCollision Detection\nWhen things touch, they are said to have collided. Detecting when this happens is called collision detection. Unity provides collision detection through its physics engine, which might seem odd, but the part of Unity that is concerned with making things move realistically needs to know how and when things collide so that it can animate them. The point to stress here is that even if you aren't doing physics as we normally understand it, you still need Unity's physics components to detect if things are touching or not.\n2D vs 3D\nThis is further complicated by the fact that Unity actually has two physics engines built in, one for 3D physics and one for 2D physics. They are distinct engines that do not interact, so you normally have to pick one for your game and use it. Furthermore, the 2D engine was added later, so Components that use it have 2D added to their name (e.g. Rigidbody2D, BoxCollider2D). Physics Components without 2D are 3D. This lesson only uses the 2D engine.\nRigidbodies and Colliders\nAttaching the built in Rigidbody2D component to a GameObject causes it to participate in the physics simulation. By default, it will apply gravity, and setting Gravity Scale to 0 disables that. A GameObject without a Rigidbody2D is effectively ignored by the physics engine.\nThe Rigidbody2D component does not specify the shape of an object, though. That is left up to the Collider2D components. There are a bunch of them in different shapes, and you can add as many as you want to a GameObject. We use PolygonCollider2D in this lesson as it gives the tightest collision detection.\nStrictly speaking, for the collision of two objects to be detected, both need colliders and at least one needs a rigidbody. To keep things simple and consistent, we just insist that every object be given a rigidbody and a collider if we want collision detection.\nTriggers\nThere are two kinds of Colliders in Unity: Triggers and non-Triggers. When a Collider is a trigger Unity's physics engine only works to inform your code that two objects are touching, and nothing more. When a Collider is not a trigger (the default), Unity will both inform your code when two objects touch and animate the objects to bounce around in a physically realistic way. For this lesson, all of our Colliders are triggers because realistic physics would mess up the simple 2D game we are making.\nDetecting Collision\nSince we set up the enemy in the last session to have a Rigidbody2D and a PolygonCollider2D, and the Player's bullets already have a Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D attached, we're ready to start writing code! Create a new component on the Enemy named DestroySelfOnCollision that will remove the attached gameObject whenever collision is detected. Guide your class through writing the following code (not the final code yet, but close):\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class DestroySelfOnCollision : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D otherCollider)\n    {\n      Destroy(gameObject);\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation\nMost of this code is like the AlwaysLookAt component from the previous session, except with OnCollisionEnter2D in place of Update. Stress the similarities with your class.\nOnTriggerEnter2D\nRecall that Unity uses specially named C# methods to send \"messages\" to your components. Start gets called once at the start of a game, Update gets called once every frame, and here OnTriggerEnter2D gets called the first frame a trigger collision is detected. This answers our first question: How do we know when two GameObjects touch? The OnTriggerEnter2D method is called on every component attached to every GameObject involved in the collision. The order they they get called in is generally random, but you can control it to some extent.\nUnlike Start and Update, OnTriggerEnter2D passes additional information to you when it is triggered in the form of the parameter otherCollider. It is a reference to the other collider that this collider just hit. It is not a GameObject, but we can ask it for the GameObject it is attached to by otherCollider.gameObject.\nDestroy\nDestroy removes the specified GameObject, in this case gameObject is the GameObject attached to the component in question.\nPlay the Game\nPlay the game and demonstrate that this does cause the enemy to disappear when it touches bullets! However:\n\n\nThe code we wrote will cause the enemy to disappear when it touched anything, which is not what we want. We need to update our code to only react to certain objects, in this case, the player's bullets.\n"},"tags.html":{"url":"tags.html","title":"Tags","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nTags\nThere are a few ways to restrict collision between objects. Layers are option, but we're going to use tags in this lesson.\nTags are a way of grouping GameObjects. The GameObjects may have different names, components, places in the scene, but if they all share the same tag we can check for it and treat them all the same way. A tag is a string, but you have to tell Unity about all your tags beforehand.\nAdding a Tag\nOpen the Tags and Layers window and observe that we've already added a \"Bullet\" tag. Also observe that the bullet prefab is already using it. When making your own tags, these are the places in the UI where you would add new ones and associate them with GameObjects. No additional action is needed for this lesson, however.\n\n\nChecking for a Tag\nLead your class to make the following changes to the component:\n\nAdd a public field of type string named otherTag\nCheck if the object collided with has the tag otherTag before destroying\n\nThe code should look like\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class DestroySelfOnCollision : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public string otherTag;\n\n    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)\n    {\n        if (collision.gameObject.tag == otherTag)\n        {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation\nWe are using a field as before, and a value of \"Bullet\" should be provided in the inspector.\nWe then access the collision object to query the GameObject that was just collided with, and then finally that GameObject's tag, and we check to see if it is equal to the value of otherTag. Only if that is true do we destroy the GameObject.\nOne way to read this in English is \"We just collided with something (collision). Which GameObject was it (collision.gameObject)? What was its tag (collision.gameObject.tag)? Was that tag equal to the value we set otherTag to (collision.gameObject.tag == otherTag)? If so, destroy our GameObject.\"\nExperiments\n\nTry assigning different values to otherTag in the inspector\nTry != instead of ==\n\n"},"session-4.html":{"url":"session-4.html","title":"Session 4","keywords":"","body":"Session 4\nStudents make the Enemy shoot back at the player.\n\nGoals\n\nUnderstand timers\nUnderstand prefabs\nMake multiple components work together\n\nNew Code\nBy the end of the session, you will have written the following script:\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour {\n    public float timeBetweenClones = 5;\n    public float counter;\n    public GameObject clone;\n    public Vector2 offset;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        counter = timeBetweenClones;\n    }\n\n    void Update () {\n        counter = counter - Time.deltaTime;\n        if (clone && counter \n"},"shoot-back-setup.html":{"url":"shoot-back-setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Session 4\nSetup\nLay out the problem in plain english: \"Ever five seconds, the enemy should shoot a bullet at the player.

Guide your students to write the following script:\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour {\n    public GameObject clone;\n\n    void Update () {\n        Instantiate(clone, transform.position, transform.rotation);\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation\nInstantiate is Unity's way of making copies of GameObjects. To fire a stream of bullets, we actually make copies of a single bullet. Instantiate takes three arguments:\n\nWhat to clone (clone in this case)\nWhere to put the new object (transform.position, so at the enemy's position)\nHow to rotate the new object (transform.rotation, so the same rotation as the enemy)\n\nDrag the Bullet prefab from the Prefabs folder into the Clone variable in the inspector and play the game.\n\nDiscussion\nDiscuss this version of the game with your class. Some possible questions include:\n\nWhat is happening?\nWhy are there so many bullets?\nBecause Update gets called every frame\n\n\nIs this what you expected? If so, why? If not, what were you expecting?\nWhy aren't the bullets hurting the player?\nBecause Bullet prefab has destroying scripts for asteroids only\n\n\n\nExercise\nTry dragging different objects into the Clone variable to make nonsensicle variations. What happens when enemy fires Asteroids? What happens when they fire Players? The results are both hilarious and can lead to illuminating discussions.\n\nMake sure to have the class return the Bullet to the Clone variable before moving on.\n"},"timers.html":{"url":"timers.html","title":"Timers","keywords":"","body":"Session 4\nTimers\nThe first task is to make the bullets fire more slowly, or more specifically, to have control over the rate at which they spawn. The challenge is to bridge the fact that Unity's Update message is sent once every frame, but we want to clone a bullet once every certain number of seconds. That is, we have to bridge the notion of frames with the notion of seconds. This has always been a confusing subject for students! So make sure to allow for ample tome to cover it.\nFrames\nUnity creates the illusion of motion on a screen by generating many images and displaying them after each other. This is a lot like the way a movie works, except that Unity can react to a player's input and generate totally new content every time. One of these images that gets generated is called a frame.\nThe conceptual leap is that frames happen very fast, around sixty per second, but we tend to think of time in terms of seconds. There is no easy way to write code that runs once a second (Unity's coroutines can actually do this, but they're a bit advanced for a first workshop), so your code tends to be invoked once a frame. To complicate thing further, frames don't all take the same amount of time. More action and computation might cause one frame to take longer than another one.\nA diagram approximating this reality is often helpful.\n\nDemonstrate that many frames happen in one second, that they don't line up with seconds at all, and that they take a different amount of time. Note that this diagram illustrates around seven frames per second to save space, when Unity will actually run closer to sixty frames pre second.\nThis explains why so many bullets were being spawned in the earlier exercise. Our Update code was being called once a frame, so by the time a second had passed we had Instantiated around sixty bullets!\nDelta Time\nTo convert between frames and seconds, Unity provides us with Time.deltaTime, the number of seconds it took to complete the last frame, and it usually a very small number. One way to think of Time.deltaTime is as a measure of how many seconds make up a single frame. Frames per second is a common measure of how fast a game is running, and Time.deltaTime is its inverse.\nThe official Unity tutorial does a decent job of covering the concept.\n\n\nSlower Bullets\nWe're going to clone our bullet only after a certain number of seconds has passed. There are a few ways to do this in Unity, but the approach taken here is the following:\n\nSpecify how many seconds to wait between between clones. (e.g 5 seconds)\nMaintain a counter variable that initially has the same value as the number of seconds to wait between clones (e.g. 5 seconds)\nEvery frame, subtract Time.deltaTime from the counter\nIf the counter is less than zero, reset the counter and clone the bullet as before\n\nGuide your students to write the following script:\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public float timeBetweenClones = 5;\n    public float counter;\n    public GameObject clone;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        counter = timeBetweenClones;\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        counter = counter - Time.deltaTime;\n        if (counter \nExplanation\nUse the fact that all variables are public to watch their values change while the game is playing. Watching counter decrease slowly can be particularly helpful.\ntimeBetweenClones = 5;\nThe fields are largely the same, except that timeBetweenClones has a = 5 after it. This means that the default value for new CloneOnTimer components will be 5. Unity will always use the value in the inspector, however, so changing the value there will override this.\nvoid Start ()\nIn addition to Update, we need to run some logic to set things up. Start runs only once at the start of a game, and in here sets counter to have the same value as timeBetweenClones\n"},"prefabs.html":{"url":"prefabs.html","title":"Prefabs","keywords":"","body":"Session 4\nPrefabs\nWe're almost there! The last thing that's missing is the fact that the enemy is shooting the player's bullets. To fix this, we need to make a new prefab for the enemy's bullet and drag that into the CloneOnTimer Clone variable.\nA Prefab is a collection of GameObjects, Components, and field values. They are useful for objects that need to be reused. The game already has prefabs for the player's bullet (called \"Bullet\"), the losing and winning text, and the three small asteroids that spawn when a larger asteroid is destroyed.\nEnemy Bullets\nThe enemy bullet is almost identical to the player's bullet, except:\n\nIt should look different\nIt should remove the player\nIt should move slower than the player's bullet\n\nMake a copy of the Bullet prefab, rename it \"Enemy Bullet\", and give it the following component field values:\n\nThese values are identical to the Bullet prefab except in the SpriteRenderer's Sprite value, the ForwardMover's speed value, and the Destroy scripts.\nDrag the Enemy Bullet prefab on to the Clone variable of CloneOnTimer and the game is finished!\nExercise\n\nExperiment with different values for the Enemy Bullet's speed.
