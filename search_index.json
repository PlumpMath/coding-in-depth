In Depth\nThe Game\nThis module is designed around an Asteroids clone. The player controls a ship with the keyboard keys, rotating with left and right, moving forward and backward with up and down, firing bullets with the space bar, and must destroy a field of asteroids in order to win. Each asteroid spawns three smaller asteroids when destroyed, and the smaller asteroids do not spawn anything. If the user touches an asteroid, they lose. The class will write the code to add an enemy to the game with basic AI that will follow the player and fire bullets at them.\n\nIt is designed to be hit all of the major corners of Unity while remaining hackable. The components are well commented and designed to be interchanged. The package also comes with a lot of free art from kenney.nl that students can use while customizing the game.\nImportantly, the scripts that the class will write together to implement the enemy should not be on the students’ computers to begin with as this would defeat the purpose.\n"},"lesson-plan.html":{"url":"lesson-plan.html","title":"Lesson Plan","keywords":"","body":"Lesson Plan\nSummary\nThe lesson is broken up into two parts: hacking and coding.

Understanding these ideas is crucial to using Unity effectively, and working contrary to them will cause a lot of undue headache.\nGames In General\nThe core idea behind Unity is that most games are full of \"things\" that interact with each other and react to player actions in different ways over time. For example, some of the \"things\" in Asteroids are the player's ship, the asteroids, and the player's bullets. The way they interact with eachother is different for each \"thing\" and might depend on events are happening in the game. For example, when a bullet touches an asteroid, the asteroid disappears, and is replaced with three smaller asteroids. When the player presses the right arrow key, the ship turns right. Most games can be described by different \"things\" and how they interact.\n\nExercise \nHave the class identify \"things\" and interactions in other games, and suggest your own.\nUnity In Particular\nUnity calls these \"things\" GameObjects. Everything in your game is a GameObject. Players, enemies, pickups, parts of levels. Even things that are not immediately visible are GameObjects, like the area that marks the finish line in a racing game or the starting point in a platformer.\nGameObjects on their own do not do anything, and they are all equal. There is not, for example, a camera GameObject and a spaceship GameObject, just GameObjects. They are blank, empty containers waiting to be filled with the logic and behavior that comes from Components. A Component is a chunk of code designed to do one specific thing when attached to a GameObject. Some common Components are built in to Unity. These include the Camera Component that draws the scene on the screen, the Rigidbody Component that makes GameObjects move with realistic physics, or the AudioSource Component that plays sound files. You will not have to recreate these for every game. But more game-specific logic, like the way the player moves, or how pickups work, will need to be specified by the game developer by writing code.\nSo, GameObjects contain Components, and Components must be attached to GameObjects. Unity’s core idea is: everything in your game is a GameObject, and you tell GameObjects how to act and how to look by attaching Components to them.\n\nAs an example, the player's ship in Asteroids could be a GameObject with:\n\nA component specifying what image to use to draw the ship\nA component specifying its position and rotation\nA component that creates a bullet GameObject when the player presses a button\nA component that rotates the ship when the player presses left or right\nA component that moves the ship forward the player presses forward or backwards\nA component that removes the ship when it touches an Asteroid\n\nThat's a lot of components! This is how Unity wants you to build your games, though. The idea is that if you write small, generic components that aren't tied to one particular GameObject, you can re-use them on other GameObjects.\nOnce you're thinking in terms of GameObjects and Components, you're ready to take on Unity!\nThe way you organize your game, the number of Components and what goes in them is up to the developers. Every team finds a style that works for it, and it is not an exact science. For example, in the earlier Asteroids player ship example, the movement and rotation Component could be combined into one. This would not be \"wrong\" and breaking them apart is not necessarily \"better\". Stress this with your class!\nExercise \nAsk the class to try and break down popular \"things\" in video games into Unity-style Components. Ask the students what games they play and what \"things\" they contain that can be broken down, and suggest your own. Guide them towards thinking of common, reusable Components between \"things\".\nIf Mario was made in Unity, there would be no “mario” object, just a normal GameObject named Mario with a Component that says what he looks like, a Component that says how he should move, a Component that says how he can get hurt, and so on.\nTake Aways\n\nUnity organizes games into GameObjects and Components\nGameObjects organize all the \"things\" in your game and contain Components\nComponents implement behavior and logic, and only exist attached to GameObjects\nComponents are either built in to Unity or are programmed by you\nThe only way to write code in Unity is to make new components and attach them to GameObjects\n\n"},"ui.html":{"url":"ui.html","title":"Unity's UI","keywords":"","body":"Session 1\nUnity’s UI\nThe Game view shows is what the player will see, and the Project window is a list of all the files in the project, including images, sounds, and code.\nThe remaining tabs are a direct reflection of Unity's semantics. Stress that the Scene view and Hierarchy window show all the GameObjects in the game, but in different ways:\n\nThe Scene Tab is a visual, 3D representation, useful for a preview of how things will look or to move things around\nThe Hierarchy is a searchable list, useful if you can’t visually find a GameObject or if you need to see how GameObjects are nested.\n\nDemonstration Demonstrate that GameObjects can be selected by clicking on them in the Scene or Hierarchy Tabs. Stress that clicking on an object in the Scene Tab selects in Hierarchy Tab and vice versa — they are the same object.\nThe Inspector window displays information on the currently selected objects. When GameObjects are selected, it displays the GameObjects' information (name, layer, etc) as well as every Component attached to them.\nThis is an excellent place to stress the GameObject/Component relationship. The visual layout of the inspector places GameObject information at the top, and the rest is a list of Components.\n\n\n\n"},"play-and-hack.html":{"url":"play-and-hack.html","title":"Play and Hack","keywords":"","body":"Session 1\nPlay and Hack\nPlay\nHave students play the game for some time. Afterwards, ask them what they thought. Possible questions include:\n\nWas it fun?\nIf so, how?\nIf not, why?\nWhat would they change?\n\nThis does not need to be an in-depth game-literacy focused discussion, but deep enough to give the students concrete goals when they hack the game.\nHack the game\nHave youd students tweak values, add and remove components so that the game plays differently without writing code. The challenge is to make a game that is as different as possible before any code is introduced. This stresses the importance and power of the GameObject/Compoent design of Unity. Ideally, this excersise will lead students to get excited by modifying the game, but frustrated at the limitations of value tweaking. This frustration speaks to the importance of writing code, whithout which you are beholden to modifying the work of others.\nThe components that make up the game are designed for this.

Their relationship is important to explain.\nC# the language\nC# is a language designed by Microsoft in 1999. It is object oriented, meaning it wants you to organize your code into classes. Classes are collections of data called fields and code called methods. C# doesn't tell you exactly how you organize your code, but classes, fields, and methods are the tools it gives you.\nAnother important aspect of C# is that it is statically typed, meaning that every value has to be annotated with the type of data it represents. A type can be something built in to C#, like numbers (e.g. int, float) or a class written in C#. In practice, these classes either come from Microsoft (like DateTime), Unity (like AudioClip), a library you imported, or you.\nClasses vs Instances\nThe difference between classes and instances is a consistent source of confusion, and unfortunately unavoidable in Unity. A class is a blueprint from which instances (or \"objects\") can be made. You can then access the instance fields and methods on that instance.\nVector3 v = new Vector3(3, 4, 5); // v is now an instance of the class Vector3\nv.x;                              // you can access the x instance field\nv.Set(300, 400, 500);             // you can access the Set instance method\n\nBut classes are more than just blueprints. They can contain their own fields and methods that can be accessed from anywhere in the program!\nVector3 w = new Vector3(7, 3, 1);\nVector3 v = new Vector3(3, 4, 5);\nVector3.Distance(w, v); // Vector3.Distance is a method that lives in the Vector3 class itself\nInput.GetKey(\"space\");  // Input.GetKey is a method that lives in the Input class\n\nThis appears to invalidate the \"everything is a GameObject or Component\" rule, but that rule is only true of Unity. C# has its own rules, and to use Unity effectively you need work towards understanding both systems.\nC# In Unity\nUnity uses C#'s object oriented features to implement very different ideas, namely the entity-component-system. These two approaches can seem in tension at times, and can result in a bit of repetitive code.\nWhen you write your own components, you do that by writing a C# class. When you expose parameters to the Unity inspector, you do that by writing public C# fields. When you react to Unity events, you do that by writing C# methods.\n"},"boilerplate.html":{"url":"boilerplate.html","title":"Boilerplate","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nBoilerplate\nWe're ready to write our first of two components! Add a new component called AlwaysLookAt, and Unity will generate the following code:\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class AlwaysLookAt : MonoBehaviour {\n\n    // Use this for initialization\n    void Start () {\n\n    }\n\n    // Update is called once per frame\n    void Update () {\n\n    }\n}\n\nSyntax\nThere's a lot of stuff here, and to avoid the sense that anything is magic, walk your students through the syntax.\nusing\nThe using directive makes types available to this file with shorter names. C# types live inside of namespaces to avoid overlapping names. Almost everything in Unity is in the UnityEngine namespace, which means that the full names of Unity types are actually UnityEngine.Vector3 and UnityEngine.Collider. This is repetitive, so the using directive says \"in this file, use names from UnityEngine without repeating UnityEngine. every time\". Unity also adds using directives for System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic, which are namespaces built in to C# that Unity thinks are useful.\npublic class AlwaysLookAt : MonoBehaviour\npublic class tells C# that we're about to start writing a class and that it is going to be public, meaning other code can see and use it. Recall that Unity components are implemented as C# classes, and we're going to have to create a class everytime we want to make a new component. You will always want your components to be public, otherwise Unity cannot see or use it. There are other keywords you can put here, called the accessibility levels, and they are useful for C# classes in general to organize your code, but for a Unity component this will always be public.\nFollowing that, finally something familiar: AlwaysLookAt is the name of our component!\nThe : in this context means that our class will inherit from another class, in this case from Unity's MonoBehaviour. C# inheritance is a big topic, and does not come up very often in Unity, so its up to you how deep to get into that. But recall that Components are either built in to Unity or scripts written by developers. inheriting from MonoBehaviour tells Unity that this isn't a \"normal\" C# class, but instead a class intended to be used as a user-defined component.\n//\nC# comments are either // to the end of the line anything between /* and */. The computer ignores this text and its a good place for notes.\nvoid Start (), void Update (),\nUnity calls the events that GameObjects can react to Messages (scroll down half way on the MonoBehaviour page). They are implemented as C# methods on component classes.\nBasically, by writing methods with the right name, Unity will trigger that code when appropriate. It provides components with Start (triggered once when the game starts) and Update (triggered once per frame) methods by default, to be useful. We only need Update, so you can remove Start if you wish or leave it in, it makes no difference.\n"},"fields.html":{"url":"fields.html","title":"Fields","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nFields\nFields are bits of data that components carry around.

Recall that C# is statically typed, meaning we need to announce the kind of data we're manipulating at all times. So this field can store a GameObject.\ntarget\nThis is the name of the field. We see it in the inspector, and this is the name we will use for it in our code. Note that the name as it appears in the inspector (capitalized) is a convenience, and shouldn't be used in code.\nAssigning Values\nAs you can see in the inspector, the default value is None, meaning that target's value is null. We want target to refer to the Player GameObject in the scene so that the next bit of our code can use it. You can give it a value in one of two ways: clicking the little circle on the right brings up a browsable list of all available GameObjects in the project and scene.\n\nOr, the Player object can be dragged in from the Hierarchy.\n\n"},"turning-logic.html":{"url":"turning-logic.html","title":"Turning Logic","keywords":"","body":"Session 2\nTurning Logic\nNow that the target field has a value, making the enemy turn to face is a single line of code, but that line is quite dense.

To understand that, we need to talk about the Transform component and some linear algebra\nThe Transform Component\n\nEvery GameObject in Unity gets a Transform component. It stores the position, rotation, and scale of the GameObject, and enables the nesting of GameObjects (it keeps track of children and parents). It's so important to Unity that you can't even remove it!\nSince the Transform component controls rotation, if we want our AlwaysLookAt component to rotate the GameObject it has to talk to the Transform component. There are a few ways to do this, including the Rotate method, or setting the rotation or eulerAngles properties.\nFor the purposes of this script, however, the easiest thing to do is to set the up property. The up property corresponds to the green axis as seen in the scene view.\n\nIt is a vector, so it is an indication of direction. Assigning it a new value will rotate the object so that the green arrow is facing this new direction. Since our green arrow lines up with the front of the enemy, this causes the enemy to turn and \"face\" in that new direction!\nSyntax\nThe . operator is the member access operator. You can read transform.up as \"get me the thing called up from inside the transform object\". Here, transform is shorthand for this.transform, which in turn is shorthand for this.gameObject.transform. this is a special keyword in C# that refers to the current object that your code is running on, in this case the AlwaysLookAt component. The gameObject field refers to the GameObject the component is attached to, and the transform field refers to the Transform component attached to that GameObject. So, transform.up can be read as \"get me the up property of the Transform component attached to the same GameObject as me\" from the perspective of the AlwaysLookAt component.\nAssigning a new value is done with the = operator, which assigns the result of the expression on the right of the = symbol to whatever is on the left of the = symbol. transform.up = target.transform.position - transform.position; can be read as \"Assign to the up property of the Transform component attached to the same GameObject as me the result of target.transform.position - transform.position\".\nWe are subtracting two values, target.transform.position and transform.position. Both are accessing the position property of Transform components, but they're accessing them on different GameObjects. Recall that target is a field that we set up that was of type GameObject and we associated it with the Player's GameObject. When we say target.transform.position, we're accessing the position property of the Transform component attached to the GameObject associated with target, in this case the Player. When we say transform.position, we are using the same shorthands mentioned above to access the position property on the Transform component of the GameObject this component is attached to. So we are subtracting the position of the GameObject AlwaysLookAt is attached to (the enemy) from the position of the target (the player).\nBut what does subtracting positions give us?\nLinear Algebra\nIn addition to logic, certain kinds of math are unavoidable in game development. Chief among them is linear algebra, the mathematics of vectors, matrices, and space. Using the fact that points in space can be interpreted as vectors from the origin to those points, we can see below on the right that subtracting two points gives us a vector pointing from one to the other.\n\n\nFrom http://www.askiitians.com/iit-jee-physics/general-physics/addition-and-subtraction-of-vectors.aspx\n\nImagine that the enemy GameObject is at b in the above example, and the Player is at a. Subtracting their positions gives us the vector to look at in order for b to face a, for the enemy to face the player. If we set the green axis (transform.up) to this vector, the enemy will turn to align itself and appear to look at the player.\nExperiments\nA good way to drive home abstract concepts like these is with miniature experiments. Try the following as a class, and discuss the differences you observe:\n\nReplace the line of code in Update with\ntransform.up = transform.position - target.transform.position;\ntransform.right = target.transform.position - transform.position;\ntransform.up = -1 * (target.transform.position - transform.position);\ntransform.up = Vector3.right\n\n\nIn the inspector, associate different objects with target\n\n"},"session-3.html":{"url":"session-3.html","title":"Session 3","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nStudents make the Enemy respond to collision with the player's bullets by disappearing.\n\nGoals\n\nBegin to understand Unity's physics engine\nMake multiple components work together\n\nNew Code\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class DestroySelfOnCollision : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public string otherTag;\n\n    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)\n    {\n        if (collision.gameObject.tag == otherTag)\n        {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n"},"destroy-setup.html":{"url":"destroy-setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nSetup\nLay out the problem in plain english: \"When the player's bullet touches the enemy, the enemy should disappear\" and begin to break that down into questions:\n\n\"When the player's bullet touches the enemy\"\nHow do we know when two GameObjects touch?\nHow do we tell GameObjects apart?\n\n\n\"the enemy should disappear\"\nHow do we remove GameObjects?\n\n\n\nThese three questions will guide the session.\n"},"collision.html":{"url":"collision.html","title":"Collision Detection","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nCollision Detection\nWhen things touch, they are said to have collided. Detecting when this happens is called collision detection. Unity provides collision detection through its physics engine, which might seem odd, but the part of Unity that is concerned with making things move realistically needs to know how and when things collide so that it can animate them. The point to stress here is that even if you aren't doing physics as we normally understand it, you still need Unity's physics components to detect if things are touching or not.\n2D vs 3D\nThis is further complicated by the fact that Unity actually has two physics engines built in, one for 3D physics and one for 2D physics. They are distinct engines that do not interact, so you normally have to pick one for your game and use it. Furthermore, the 2D engine was added later, so Components that use it have 2D added to their name (e.g. Rigidbody2D, BoxCollider2D). Physics Components without 2D are 3D. This lesson only uses the 2D engine.\nRigidbodies and Colliders\nAttaching the built in Rigidbody2D component to a GameObject causes it to participate in the physics simulation. By default, it will apply gravity, and setting Gravity Scale to 0 disables that. A GameObject without a Rigidbody2D is effectively ignored by the physics engine.\nThe Rigidbody2D component does not specify the shape of an object, though. That is left up to the Collider2D components. There are a bunch of them in different shapes, and you can add as many as you want to a GameObject. We use PolygonCollider2D in this lesson as it gives the tightest collision detection. Colliders can be triggers, which means they do not react physically, and generate different messages. We are not using trigegrs in this lesson.\nStrictly speaking, for the collision of two objects to be detected, both need colliders and at least one needs a rigidbody. To keep things simple and consistent, we just insist that every object be given a rigidbody and a collider if we want collision detection.\nDetecting Collision\nSince we set up the enemy in the last session to have a Rigidbody2D and a PolygonCollider2D, and the Player's bullets already have a Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D attached, we're ready to start writing code! Create a new component on the Enemy named DestroySelfOnCollision that will remove the attached gameObject whenever collision is detected. Guide your class through writing the following code (not the final code yet, but close):\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class DestroySelfOnCollision : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)\n    {\n      Destroy(gameObject);\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation\nMost of this code is like the AlwaysLookAt component from the previous session, except with OnCollisionEnter2D in place of Update. Stress the similarities with your class.\nOnCollisionEnter2D\nRecall that Unity uses specially named C# methods to send \"messages\" to your components. Start gets called once at the start of a game, Update gets called once every frame, and here OnCollisionEnter2D gets called the first frame of a collision detected. This answers our first question: How do we know when two GameObjects touch? The OnCollisionEnter2D method is called on every component attached to every GameObject involved in the collision. The order they they get called in is generally random, but you can control it to some extent.\nUnlike Start and Update, OnCollisionEnter2D passes additional information to you when it is triggered in the form of the parameter collision. This describes the collision, and has properties like contacts (the specific points where the collision occurred) and relativeVelocity, the relative velocity of the colliding objects.\nDestroy\nDestroy removes the specified GameObject, in this case gameObject is the GameObject attached to the component in question.\nPlay the Game\nPlay the game and demonstrate that this does cause the enemy to disappear when it touches bullets! However:\n\n\nThe code we wrote will cause the enemy to disappear when it touched anything, which is not what we want. We need to update our code to only react to certain objects, in this case, the player's bullets.\n"},"tags.html":{"url":"tags.html","title":"Tags","keywords":"","body":"Session 3\nTags\nThere are a few ways to restrict collision between objects. Layers are option, but we're going to use tags in this lesson.\nTags are a way of grouping GameObjects. The GameObjects may have different names, components, places in the scene, but if they all share the same tag we can check for it and treat them all the same way. A tag is a string, but you have to tell Unity about all your tags beforehand.\nAdding a Tag\nOpen the Tags and Layers window and observe that we've already added a \"Bullet\" tag. Also observe that the bullet prefab is already using it. When making your own tags, these are the places in the UI where you would add new ones and associate them with GameObjects. No additional action is needed for this lesson, however.\n\n\nChecking for a Tag\nLead your class to make the following changes to the component:\n\nAdd a public field of type string named otherTag\nCheck if the object collided with has the tag otherTag before destroying\n\nThe code should look like\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class DestroySelfOnCollision : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public string otherTag;\n\n    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)\n    {\n        if (collision.gameObject.tag == otherTag)\n        {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation\nWe are using a field as before, and a value of \"Bullet\" should be provided in the inspector.\nWe then access the collision object to query the GameObject that was just collided with, and then finally that GameObject's tag, and we check to see if it is equal to the value of otherTag. Only if that is true do we destroy the GameObject.\nOne way to read this in English is \"We just collided with something (collision). Which GameObject was it (collision.gameObject)? What was its tag (collision.gameObject.tag)? Was that tag equal to the value we set otherTag to (collision.gameObject.tag == otherTag)? If so, destroy our GameObject.\"\nExperiments\n\nTry assigning different values to otherTag in the inspector\nTry != instead of ==\n\n"},"session-4.html":{"url":"session-4.html","title":"Session 4","keywords":"","body":"Session 4\nStudents make the Enemy shoot back at the player.\n\nGoals\n\nUnderstand timers\nUnderstand prefabs\nMake multiple components work together\n\nNew Code\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour {\n    public float timeBetweenClones = 5;\n    public float counter;\n    public GameObject clone;\n    public Vector2 offset;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        counter = timeBetweenClones;\n    }\n\n    void Update () {\n        counter = counter - Time.deltaTime;\n        if (clone && counter \n\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour {\n    public GameObject clone;\n\n    void Update () {\n        Instantiate(clone, transform.position, transform.rotation);\n    }\n}\n\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour {\n    public GameObject clone;\n    public Vector2 offset;\n\n    void Update () {\n        Instantiate(clone, transform.position + transform.TransformDirection(new Vector3(offset.x, offset.y, 0)), transform.rotation);\n    }\n}\n\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour {\n    public float timeBetweenClones = 5;\n    public float counter;\n    public GameObject clone;\n    public Vector2 offset;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        counter = timeBetweenClones;\n    }\n\n    void Update () {\n        counter = counter - Time.deltaTime;\n        if (clone && counter \n\n"},"shoot-back-setup.html":{"url":"shoot-back-setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Session 4\nSetup\nLay out the problem in plain english: \"Ever five seconds, the enemy should shoot a bullet at the player.

The challenge is to bridge the fact that Unity's Update message is sent once every frame, but we want to clone a bullet once every certain number of seconds. That is, we have to bridge the notion of frames with the notion of seconds. This has always been a confusing subject for students! So make sure to allow for ample tome to cover it.\nFrames\nUnity creates the illusion of motion on a screen by generating many images and displaying them after each other. This is a lot like the way a movie works, except that Unity can react to a player's input and generate totally new content every time. One of these images that gets generated is called a frame.\nThe conceptual leap is that frames happen very fast, around sixty per second, but we tend to think of time in terms of seconds. There is no easy way to write code that runs once a second (Unity's coroutines can actually do this, but they're a bit advanced for a first workshop), so your code tends to be invoked once a frame. To complicate thing further, frames don't all take the same amount of time. More action and computation might cause one frame to take longer than another one.\nA diagram approximating this reality is often helpful.\n\nDemonstrate that many frames happen in one second, that they don't line up with seconds at all, and that they take a different amount of time. Note that this diagram illustrates around seven frames per second to save space, when Unity will actually run closer to sixty frames pre second.\nThis explains why so many bullets were being spawned in the earlier exercise. Our Update code was being called once a frame, so by the time a second had passed we had Instantiated around sixty bullets!\nDelta Time\nTo convert between frames and seconds, Unity provides us with Time.deltaTime, the number of seconds it took to complete the last frame, and it usually a very small number. One way to think of Time.deltaTime is as a measure of how many seconds make up a single frame. Frames per second is a common measure of how fast a game is running, and Time.deltaTime is its inverse.\nThe official Unity tutorial does a decent job of covering the concept.\n\n\nSlower Bullets\nWe're going to clone our bullet only after a certain number of seconds has passed. There are a few ways to do this in Unity, but the approach taken here is the following:\n\nSpecify how many seconds to wait between between clones. (e.g 5 seconds)\nMaintain a counter variable that initially has the same value as the number of seconds to wait between clones (e.g. 5 seconds)\nEvery frame, subtract Time.deltaTime from the counter\nIf the counter is less than zero, reset the counter and clone the bullet as before\n\nGuide your students to write the following script:\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CloneOnTimer : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public float timeBetweenClones = 5;\n    public float counter;\n    public GameObject clone;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        counter = timeBetweenClones;\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        counter = counter - Time.deltaTime;\n        if (counter \nExplanation\nUse the fact that all variables are public to watch their values change while the game is playing. Watching counter decrease slowly can be particularly helpful.\ntimeBetweenClones = 5;\nThe fields are largely the same, except that timeBetweenClones has a = 5 after it. This means that the default value for new CloneOnTimer components will be 5. Unity will always use the value in the inspector, however, so changing the value there will override this.\nvoid Start ()\nIn addition to Update, we need to run some logic to set things up.

This is non-critical information, but might help answer questions that come up.\nIn many respects, video game development is a lot like other kinds of programming. It is unique in one important way, however: the goal is an aesthetic, human experience. This means “success” is highly subjective, and as a result iteration and playtesting are indispensable. The effect that has on the kind of programming you end up doing in games is that the flexibility of your code is important to ensure that you remain able to adapt to new creative ideas. This is radically different from, say, programming a server, where there will be a specification and a narrow definition of what is correct. Here, iteration is less important, and the kind of code you write changes accordingly.\n_start:\n        # write(1, message, 13)\n        mov     $1, %rax\n        mov     $1, %rdi\n        mov     $message, %rsi\n        mov     $13, %rdx\n        syscall\n        mov     $60, %rax\n        xor     %rdi, %rdi\n        syscall\nmessage:\n        .ascii  \"Hello, world\\n\"\n\nFrom http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x86assembly/\n\nThe original programming paradigm of the 1950s was imperative, where programs were nothing more than a sequence of machine level commands. There were no named variables, limited support for named blocks of code, mostly memory addresses that could be read and written to, no loops or conditionals, just “branch statements” to jump to different instructions, and no named functions, just blocks of code. Assembly languages for different computers fall into this category, and this kind of programming is still done on some low level systems.\n#include \n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\n}\n\nFrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#.22Hello.2C_world.22_example\n\nShortly following that was the structured programming of the late 1950s and 1960s. Most of the progress was being made in America, and these languages allowed programmers to assign English names to their variables and functions which made it easier for them to read and manage.\n"},"type-along.html":{"url":"type-along.html","title":"Type-along Coding","keywords":"","body":"Type-along Coding\nTo thoroughly demonstrate each step of the writing of code, we encourage alternating between writing code live in front of students and taking time to answer questions individually while they transcribe it. Broken down into steps:\n\nBeforehand, break the coding into chunks or steps that can fit on a single screen\nConnect your laptop to a projector and mirror the displays\nWrite code live and ask your students to type-along with you\nWhen finished typing, expect a few advanced students to be caught up, but most students to still be typing\nPose a challenge to the students who are done, suggesting the next step\nTake a moment to go around the room and make sure everyone else is caught up\nHave short one-on-one conversations with each student about the state of their code, what they are confused about, and answer questions they may not be willing to ask out loud (In a large classroom, this is a good task for teaching assistants or co-teachers to help with)\nWhen finished, return to your computer, have a short discussion about the chunk everyone just wrote, and begin the next step.\n\nThis approach has several benefits:\n\nThe current step remains on the screen for students to transcribe at their own pace\nAsking the students to type the code themselves (as opposed to downloading or copy-pasting) acquaints them with the tactile experience of writing code with their fingers, and the particularities of text editing tools\nYou will make mistakes when writing code — that’s great! This demonstrates that encountering errors regularly, dealing with them, and moving on are a fundamental part of the experience of programming\nYou can structure your code steps to keep advanced students challenged while helping those who are not caught up\nYou ensure that everyone is on the same page before moving on, and its harder for someone to fall way behind\n\nMake sure your font size is large enough to be read comfortably by everyone in the room. This might mean writing code at a comically large size, and might affect your ability to write code comfortably. Experiment with this during classroom preparation if possible.\n"},"errors.html":{"url":"errors.html","title":"Errors","keywords":"","body":"Errors\nIt is important to stress the point about errors in the type-along coding chapter. There is a myth among programmers, particularly among new programmers, that errors are “wrong” and a sign that they’re “not good” at programming. Some have the feeling that when they’re “good” programmers, they simply will not see error messages again.\n\nThe aesthetics of error messages encourage this: stop signs, exclamation points, bombs with lit fuses, ominous red and black text. This, of course, couldn’t be farther from the truth, and this is an excellent opportunity to push back against that notion.\nTalking about error messages is tricky to do. It is easy to sound condescending, which defeats the purpose. By live coding and demonstrating that errors are not a big deal and that “even the instructor” consistently makes them and deals with them, though, you can communicate this point more powerfully.\nA Friend with a Bagel\nWe've explain programming errors as \"situations where the computer does not have enough information to proceed and is asking for help\" or \"situations where what you wanted is not clear to the computer.\" An example we like to give is asking a friend to grab you a bagel from the deli when they head out. If it turns out that the deli has three kinds of bagels, your friend wouldn’t know which one you wanted, so they might phone you and ask. That phone call is an error message. This is both closer to technical reality and much less off-putting to new programmers.\n"}}}
