# Session 3
## Setup

Lay out the problem in plain english: "When the player's bullet touches the enemy, the enemy should disappear" and begin to break that down into questions:

1. "When the player's bullet touches the enemy"
  1. How do we know when two GameObjects touch?
  2. How do we tell GameObjects apart?
1. "the enemy should disappear"
  1. How do we remove GameObjects?

These three questions will guide the session.
