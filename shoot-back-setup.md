# Session 4
## Setup

Lay out the problem in plain english: "Ever five seconds, the enemy should shoot a bullet at the player. If the enemy's bullet touches the player, the player should disappear and begin to break that down into questions:

1. How do we add new objects to a game?
2. How do we perform actions on a timer?

These questions will guide the session.
