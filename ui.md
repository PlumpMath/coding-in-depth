# Session 1
## Unity’s UI

The [Game view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html) shows is what the player will see, and the [Project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) is a list of all the files in the project, including images, sounds, and code.

The remaining tabs are a direct reflection of [Unity's semantics](semantics.md). Stress that the [Scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html) and [Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) **show all the GameObjects in the game**, but in different ways:
  - The Scene Tab is a visual, 3D representation, useful for a preview of how things will look or to move things around
  - The Hierarchy is a searchable list, useful if you can’t visually find a GameObject or if you need to see how GameObjects are nested.
  
**Demonstration** Demonstrate that GameObjects can be selected by clicking on them in the Scene or Hierarchy Tabs. Stress that clicking on an object in the Scene Tab selects in Hierarchy Tab and vice versa — they are the same object.

The [Inspector window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) displays information on *the currently selected objects*. When GameObjects are selected, it displays the GameObjects' information (name, layer, etc) as well as every Component attached to them.

This is an excellent place to stress the GameObject/Component relationship. The visual layout of the inspector places GameObject information at the top, and the rest is a list of Components.
